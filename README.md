# jagi
JAGI is a fork of Dr Zoltan's Java AGI engine that can be found on sourceforge here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/agi/

The initial import of the code was taking from the above sourceforge CVS repo on the 29th October 2016. The code in that repo, however, had not changed in many years, so in the most part this initial version of the code dates back to 2001-2002.
